            <blockquote>
                Healthy eating is important for many reasons, including fueling your body, acquiring necessary nutrients, lowering your disease risk, increasing your longevity, and promoting optimal mental and physical well-being.Healthy eating doesn't involve any particular diet. Rather, it means prioritizing your health by fueling your body with nutrient-rich foods.Include a variety of nutrient-dense, whole foods in your diet, taking care to limit highly processed items.You should limit your intake of ultra-processed foods and drinks like candy, soda, and sugary cereals, but that doesn't mean that you have to eliminate these items from your diet.Tips like cooking at home, grocery shopping, eating a lot of plant foods, choosing filling meals and snacks, and honoring your dislikes can help you create and maintain a healthy eating pattern.
